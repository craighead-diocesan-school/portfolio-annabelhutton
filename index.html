    <h2>My Project</h2>
    <p>
      In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project was ballon pop
    </p>
    <p>
       Our game ballon pop you had to aim with a dart to pop a ballon in a square. The ballons are on some string going around in circles while our chip was picking up on noise to see weather the people would be rewarded with lollies
      </p>
      <p>
        while we were putting the frame together we had to come up with certain shapes and sizes that woul fit our project, it had to be changed a few times along with the rasterbation we put together at first it was to big and then too small. Then we had to find a way to make the string go around the frame for the balloons to go on, it took us a few goes but ended up coming up with a better sulution. Balloons were put on and then we found they kept getting stuck around the corners so we decided to attach them with rubber bands.
      </p>
      <p>
        We then added the micro bit to the creation to make it glow up when a loud sound happens, we sort of forgot about it on the day and it didnt really matter.  
      </p>
    <p>
      It came to the day of the market, and everything was set up and no one came...
