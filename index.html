    <h2>My Project</h2>
    <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project was ballon pop</p>
    <p></p> Our game ballon pop you had to aim with a dart to pop a ballon in a square. The ballons are on some string going around in circles while our chip was picking up on noise to see weather the people would be rewarded with lollies
